# ag-project-practice

Currently two working files.  `sowing_field_float_practice` is older and was created to start writing an environment that permits sowing plants at any floating-point x,y location.  

`field_env_sowing_agent` is newer, and has a cleanly delineated environment and agent.  Look to this file for the most up-to-date code.
